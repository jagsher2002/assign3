# assign3
For my WeCare App i created 4 models here-Child, Parent, Teacher, Daily-Activity and made relationships between them. As a result of which when I enter information about the child it gaves me options of selecting parent, teacher, activity related to the child. My all CRUD operations are working as demanded in the assignment and i also added homepage regarding the information of my app and i customized the footer section with my name and student id.also i add authentication so that anonymous users can view the list of data but cannot see the Create, Edit, or Delete links and make the google sign by making settings in the google for login.
I tried like thousand times to fix my last repository, the one I submitted last time still I had to make a new one. However, all set noe this is working perfectly.
